# My Python Projects
This is a collection of my first Python projects. Each file is a separate mini-program that demonstrates my basic knowledge in Python programming.

## Project Descriptions
1. **User Info App**
The program accepts the user's name, nickname, phone number, and prints a greeting.

2. **Simple Calculator**
The program allows the user to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers entered by the user.

3. **List Operations**
Creating, editing, merging, and displaying lists.

4. **List + Add Method**
The same as above but using the __add__() method for list concatenation.

5. **Dictionary Access**
Working with a dictionary â€” retrieving values by keys (e.g., price or brand).

6. **Set Intersection**
Set intersection, adding values, and converting to a list.

7. **Conditions & Loops**
Examples of if, elif, else, for, while loops, and value checks.

8. **Football Player Stats**
Dictionaries with football player data: calculating averages, updating statistics, and adding a new player.
